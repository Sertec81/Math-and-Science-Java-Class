    Declare an integer named length and initialize it to 10 on the same line.

    on the same line, declare and initialize two more integers named "width" and "height".

    Declare a final integer name "volume" and initialize it to be equal to "length*width*height". The "volume"
    variable is dynamically initialized to a value that is calculated when the program runs.
    *
    Print out the value of the volume to the screen.
